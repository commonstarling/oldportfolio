  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a journalist and editor turned front-end developer who is combining my love of good writing with my interest in good coding. Since I love the Internet and spend a significant portion of my days perusing it, I'm excited to contribute to how others see and use the Web.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I spent most of my childhood growing up in Fenton, Michigan -- a suburb of Flint, Michigan (yes, the city from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_%26_Me" target="_blank">Roger & Me</a>). However, I spent a significant portion of my adult life in metro Detroit and consider that my hometown. Nowadays, I live in Chicago with my husband and baby daughter, who are both Chicago natives.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I love reading and dancing -- any type of dance will do, but salsa is my absolute favorite. I also love listening to and discovering new hip-hop music, as well as learning about samples used in hip-hop songs.</p>
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>  
  <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/blu-official/tracks" target="_blank">Blu</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Brother_(group)" target="_blank">Little Brother</a> are two of my favorite hip-hop artists/groups, and so I have them on heavy rotation. The same goes for <a href="http://www.hectorlavoe.com/" target="_blank">Hector Lavoe</a>, who is my favorite salsa artist of all time.</p>
